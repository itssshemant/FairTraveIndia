# FairTravel – Community-Based Fair Price Checker for Travelers

FairTravel is a web application designed to help travelers avoid overcharging by comparing asked prices with community-verified fair price ranges for common services like rides, food, and tickets.

## 🚩 Problem
Tourists and new visitors are often overcharged due to lack of local price awareness, especially in unfamiliar cities. Existing travel apps focus on reviews but rarely provide **transparent, real-world pricing guidance**.

## 💡 Solution
FairTravel allows users to:
- Check whether a quoted price is **fair, overpriced, or unusually low**
- View **community-verified price ranges**
- Get instant verdicts with clear explanations
- Report overcharging incidents to improve transparency

## 🔥 Key Feature – Fair Price Verdict Engine
Users enter:
- City
- Service category (Ride, Food, Ticket, etc.)
- Price they were asked to pay

The system compares this against community price ranges and instantly flags:
- ✅ Fair price  
- ⚠️ Possible overcharge  
- 🤔 Unusually low price  

This logic-based decision feature makes FairTravel a **practical travel companion**, not just an informational app.
